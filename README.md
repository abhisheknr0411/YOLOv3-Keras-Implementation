# YOLOv3-Keras-Implementation

This is a basic Keras implementation of the YOLOv3 architecture for object detection using Convolutional Neural Networks.


You only look once, or YOLO, is one of the faster object detection algorithms out there. Though it is no longer the most accurate object detection algorithm, it is a very good choice when you need real-time detection, without loss of too much accuracy.
A few weeks back, the third version of YOLO came out, and this post aims at explaining the changes introduced in YOLO v3. This is not going to be a post explaining what YOLO is from the ground up. I assume you know how YOLO v2 works. If that is not the case, I recommend you to check out the following papers by Joseph Redmon et all, to get a hang of how YOLO works.
